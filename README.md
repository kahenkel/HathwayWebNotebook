# HathwayWebNotebook

A web app for an online notebook of up to 5 pages.

You can navigate to each of the 5 pages and enter text onto each page. If you refresh the browser page, the text will persist. If you open a new tab with the web app in it, the new notebook will behave like a separate notebook with its own pages/text.

## Build instructions
From a terminal:
```
npm install
ng serve --open
```
